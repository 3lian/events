# Introduction
Welcome! This is a central resource to collect upcoming events the Decred community will be attending, highlighting how you can get involved. We are also building out a best practice guide for community members to brief themselves on if they are representing Decred at an event. 

### You probably want to do one of the following:

[See upcoming events](https://github.com/heyvj/decred-events/wiki/Upcoming-Events)

[View logs for past events](https://github.com/heyvj/Decred-Events/tree/master/Event-Logs)

[Add an event Decred is participating in to this repo](https://github.com/heyvj/decred-events/wiki/Submit-an-Event)

[Read about best practices for event attendance](https://github.com/heyvj/decred-events/wiki/Best-Practices)


## Get involved
Opportunities for community members to be involved with events will be shown here whenever there are opportunities.

## Objectives
### 1. Upcoming Events
* List all future events where Decred will have a presence in the next 12 months
* Encourage the community to get involved by participating and helping with event organisation
[View upcoming events](https://github.com/heyvj/decred-events/wiki/Upcoming-Events)

### 2. Past Events
* Single destination for event write-ups and logs
* Show the community what Decred has been doing for marketing and awareness through event participation
[View write ups from past events](https://github.com/heyvj/decred-events/tree/master/Event-Logs)

### 3. Best Practices and How-Tos for Events
* Collate learnings from various events into a single location so Decred can boss events as our shared experience of event participation grows
* Ensure community participants are as effective as possible by using and building our collective experience

## How to use

### Permissions & Collaboration
I've structured in this way so that a core team of collaborators can keep the Wiki updated with upcoming events.

Anyone can then submit pull requests to the code repo with event logs and photos which will be reviewed and merged by one of the collaborators.
