Overall experience: Decred organised a meet-up in Bogota, Colombia, with the local support and co-hosting of Blockchain Academy Colombia, as part of their regular meet-ups on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. They are one of the most well known and respected start-ups in Colombia working to develop cryptocurrency and blockchain communities, they are supporting projects to get closer to the Colombian ecosystem and to educate on innovative technologies. 

We got the chance to present the project to the local community of entrepreneurs, developers and enthusiasts of Bogota. The presentation was a high level overview of the project main characteristics: its cypherpunk ethos, the hybrid blockchain PoW/PoS, Politeia, the contractor model and our plans for the future: Of particular interest for the devs on the audience was the integration of Lightening Network, Decred’s devs involvement in the development of Atomic Swaps and the possibility of ticket splitting through the LN. 

The question of the audience were very interesting and allowed for a deep conversation about Decred. Some of the most interesting question were about the attack vectors to the decision making process of Decred, the role of PoS tickets on the validation of Decred’s blockchain, what gives value to Decred and how is the social contract of Decred maintained. There were also interesting question about the degree of decentralisation of Decred’s DAO and how sustainable funding can allow open source projects to worry about coding instead of profiting. 

I was glad to have such level of question as it is a reflexion of and audience that is aware of the many nuances of creating a global digital currency under the foundations of global, P2P, uncensurable, permission less, self-governed Store of Value scare digital asset.
