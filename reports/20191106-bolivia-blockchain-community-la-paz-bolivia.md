## Overview

I met Huascar Miranda through researching the crypto and blockchain scene in Bolivia. He has been the person who made it possible to get invited and give a talk about Decred and blockchain technology use cases in an event organised by engineering students from the Universidad Mayor de San Andres (UMSA), the biggest university in Bolivia. And through him I managed to get invited to talk about blockchain governance with a local community called Bolivian Mind Blockchain. In both events the interest and curiosity to know more about crypto and blockchain technology was obvious, probably due to the lack of information and local initiatives to develop the industry, which is a result of the ban of crypto in the country since 2014.

The first event was a high-level overview of what is Bitcoin, Decred, blockchain and potential use cases for the technology. I was surprised to engage with the students and to find out they are tremendously interested in knowing more about crypto and in exploring how these technologies can be leveraged for the development of Bolivia. The majority of the attendees were students in industrial engineering and systems engineering, all of them at BA level from 6th and 7th semester. Only 2 out of 60 have had a contact with cryptocurrencies prior to the talk. It is interesting to notice that the conference was held at the National Chamber of Commerce of Bolivia.

The second talk was in a pizza place in which the audience was more diverse. Attendees were between 18 and 50 years old, with a combination of people interested in the investment side of crypto and other professionals that are looking to create a Blockchain Association in Bolivia that could allow the lobbying of these topics to the government agenda. These professionals were particularly eager to learn and replicate some of the Mexican experience to create and develop the industry in Bolivia.

## Reflection

Some of the conclusions that we can draw from the information they gave me is that the government is experimenting with Hyperledger Fabric, that younger decision makers are looking to influence the local agenda to create legal frameworks for crypto, that the main entrepreneurial efforts are happening in Santa Cruz de la Sierra (second biggest city) and not in La Paz (biggest city and administrative centre of the country), and that there is a growing number of people looking to have access to cryptocurrencies as investments but also to experiment with the technology.

Participating in these events has been interesting because it gave me more details on how the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry was brought to a halt. There were no developments since cryptocurrencies have been banned in the country in 2014 as a response from the government to scams and potential risks associated with money laundering. This ban prohibits businesses to make any operations with cryptocurrencies and for crypto to effectively have contact with the national financial system. Nonetheless, people can exchange crypto P2P and use it as long as it is not mixed with the traditional financial system. This ban has effectively stopped any entrepreneurial efforts to create cryptocurrency exchanges and has detained any advancement of the industry in the country.

Analysing the different countries in Latam, Bolivia is by far the most nascent place for crypto and blockchain. As a point of comparison, the first cryptocurrency exchange in Mexico opened in 2014, same year that the Bolivian government banned crypto. As of today there are more than 10 cryptocurrency exchanges in Mexico and none in Bolivia. Interesting to notice how the conditions set by the governments of both countries determined a completely different result in terms of the development of the cryptocurrency industry.
