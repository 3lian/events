## Overview

I met Huascar Miranda through researching the crypto and blockchain scene in Bolivia and he has been the contact that made possible to get invited to gave a talk about Decred and blockchain technology use cases in an event organised by engineering students from the Universidad Mayor de San Andres, UMSA, the biggest university in Bolivia. And through him I manage to get invited to talk about blockchain governance with a local community called Bolivian Mind Blockchain. In both events the interest and curiosity to know more about crypto and blockchain technology was obvious, probably result of the lack of information and local initiatives aimed at develop the industry due to the ban of crypto in the country since 2014.

The first event was a high-level overview of what is bitcoin, decred, blockchain and potential use cases for the technology. I was surprised to engage with the students and to find out they are tremendously interested into know more about crypto and to explore how these technologies can be leverage for the development of Bolivia. The majority of the attendees were industrial engineering students and systems engineering, all of them at BA level from 6th and 7th semester. Only 2 out of 60 have had contact with cryptocurrencies prior to the talk. Interesting to notice that the conference was held at the National Chamber of Commerce of Bolivia.

The second talk was in a Pizza place in which the audience was more diverse, attendees were between 18 and 50 years old, with a combination of people interested into the investment side of crypto and other professionals that are looking to create a Blockchain Association in Bolivia that could allow the lobbying of these topics into the government agenda. These professionals were particularly eager to know the Mexican experience in order to replicate some of these experiences to create and develop the industry in Bolivia.

## Reflection

Some of the conclusions that we can draw from the information they gave me is that the government is experimenting with hyper ledger fabric, younger decision makers are looking to influence the local agenda to create legal frameworks for crypto, that the main entrepreneurial efforts are happening in Santa Cruz de la Sierra (second biggest city) not in La Paz (biggest city and administrative centre of the country) and that there is a growing number of people looking to have access to cryptocurrencies as investments but also to experiment with the technology.

Participating in these events has been interesting because it has given me more details on how the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry has been put into a halt. There has been no developments since cryptocurrencies have been banned in the country since 2014 as a response from the government to scams and potential risks associated with money laundry. This ban prohibit any business to make operations with cryptocurrencies and for crypto to effectively have contact with the national financial system. Nonetheless, people can exchange crypto P2P and to use them as long as this is not mixed with the traditional financial system. This ban has effectively stop any entrepreneurial effort to create cryptocurrency exchanges and has detain any advancement of the industry in the country.

Analysing the different countries in Latam, Bolivia is by far the most nascent place for crypto and blockchain. As a point of comparison, the first cryptocurrency exchange in Mexico opened in 2014, same year that the Bolivian government banned crypto. As of today there are more than 10 cryptocurrency exchanges in Mexico and none in Bolivia. Interesting to notice how the conditions set by the governments of both countries determined a completely different result in terms of the development of the cryptocurrency industry.
