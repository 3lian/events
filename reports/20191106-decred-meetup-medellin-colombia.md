Overall experience: the Decred meetup in Medellin was co-organised by Blockchain Centre Colombia with the support of Impact Hub Coworking. The meetup was part of the regular events organised by Blockchain Centre Colombia and brought together around 40 entrepreneurs, devs and enthusiasts looking to learn more about Decred and its hybrid blockchain. The response to the audience was fantastic, there were very interesting question that showed a high degree of knowledge on public blockchains.

Some of the questions that were asked by the audience were related to the hybrid blockchain of Decred and the main advantages this system offers against a pure PoW consensus, the possibilities of attacking the network through gaming the PoS system, the potential of Politeia and the Treasury, how to become a contractor to the project, where to buy DCR and futures plans of the project in Colombia and Latam.

Medell√≠n has a rich entrepreneurial culture and a growing community of cryptocurrency investors and blockchain entrepreneurs looking to leverage of these technologies. The city has dedicated resources to research and develop, as part of a National plan, to understand the impact of the 4.0 industrial revolution and exponential technologies. Blockchain is an element of this plans and this is reflected in the growing number of people interested in learn about cryptocurrencies and blockchain tech.
