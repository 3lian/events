*Overall experience*

The event was held during Wednesday 25th and Thursday 26th and attracted around 150 people during both days. La Conexión aim is to connect Asian and Latin America business that work on the cryptocurrency and blockchain space. The organisers objective is to foster cooperation between startups, enterprises, foundations, civil society and the government of countries where La Conexión is celebrated. Decred was part of the sponsors for the first edition in Colombia and now once again in Argentina.

The presentation of the project was a high level overview of the fundamental characteristics of Decred: its history and cypherpunk roots, the hybrid blockchain PoW/PoS, Politeia as a governance mechanism to make changes into the protocol and into the direction of the project, an introduction into the privacy implementation and how it difference from other implementations, the contractor model and the future of the project. It was nice to receive comments about the quality of the project and its innovative nature. Particularly in the case of the hybrid blockchain, Politeia and the privacy implementation. We got a small booth in the venue in which we talk to several of the attendees and answered questions about the future of the project and our plans in Latin America.

During the two days of conference we got the chance to talk to some of the key players that assisted to the event: Diego Gutierrez, CEO of RSK (https://twitter.com/dieguito); Sara Vaca from BXB Exchange; Alberto Guerrero from criptotendencias (https://twitter.com/cripto_t); Manuel Beaudroit, CMO of Bitex Exchange (https://twitter.com/mbeaudroit); Paola Rodriguez from the innovation and entrepreneurial centre Ruta N Medellin, from Colombia; Derek Gregory from Kammas Crypto; Federico Sanchez from Kripton Market and Kleros project (https://twitter.com/federicoast); Pedro Sanchez and Dennis Campos from PundiX team in Brazil; Rodolfo Andragnes (https://twitter.com/RodolfoBits) and Fernando Secchi (https://twitter.com/fersecchi) from NGO Bitcoin Argentina; Phil Chen, decentralised chief officer at HTC (https://twitter.com/htcexodus); Gin Chao, chief strategy officer at Binance; Cesar Jimenez from StartUp Chile; Luis Kilo, community manager Latam from Binance (https://twitter.com/cryptopago); Guillermo Escudero from cryptomkt Exchange; Sasha Ivanova from NEM and Sharp Shark; Laurence Wolf from Shellpay; Cristobal Pereira from Blockchain Summit Latam (https://twitter.com/cristpereirag); Fernando Quiros from Cointelegraph en Español (https://twitter.com/FerQuiros); Leo Alduayen from Koibank; Max Carjuzaa (https://twitter.com/maxcarjuzaa) and Manuel Ferrari (https://twitter.com/manuferraritano) from Money on Chain. 

The day before La Conexión we had a lunch organised by Pedro Puma (https://twitter.com/PedroReyPuma) crypto community builder in La Plata, Argentina, with Luis Kilo, Binance latam community manager (https://twitter.com/cryptopago); Rodolfo Andragnes (https://twitter.com/RodolfoBits) founder of the NGO Bitcoin Argentina and Labitconf; Fernando Secchi (https://twitter.com/fersecchi) secretary of NGO Bitcoin Argentina; Federico Ast (https://twitter.com/federicoast) founder of Kleros, Justice as a Service platform; Federico Cardoso (https://twitter.com/ravenio) founder of Maecenas (they tokenized an Andy Warhol painting, interesting stuff).The highlights of the conversation: they all knew about Decred, the idea of Governance as a Service came to the table and opened the discussion into Justice as a Service, privacy caught their attention by its innovative implementation. Argentinians are tremendously advanced, their currency is worthless by the day and they are looking into alternatives to transform money. 

The event was a good opportunity of connect with key players in the Argentinian industry and with the general audience that uses cryptocurrencies. An interesting observation is that assistants ranged from young and elderly people exploring cryptocurrencies as a store of value and alternative to the Argentinian peso to industry professionals working on specific projects with cryptocurrencies and using blockchain technology. The economic situation of Argentina is accelerating the adoption rate and awareness of crypto as an alternative to fiat currencies. We were surprised that outside of the conference we ask people if they knew about cryptocurrencies and not 1 person said no. From cap drivers to shop vendors they all know about bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. 

Argentina Crypto Fest was held on Saturday 28th in el Parque de las Tejas, in Cordoba, Argentina, the organiser planned to have a full day of talks and music with the support of the municipality of Cordoba. We got a small booth and talked with assistants to the event. The presentation of the project was again a high level over view about Decred ethos, hybrid blockchain, privacy implementation, contractor model and the future of the treasury decentralisation. Was a good opportunity to connect with members of the bitcoin and blockchain community in Cordoba. However, we felt that the organisers lacked enough communication about the event and there were several areas that could be improved. An interesting aspect is that the event was endorsed by the local government as they are supporting innovation with blockchain technology. 

As part of the visit to Argentina, we organise meetings with other contributors in the country to talk more about their plans with the project and how we can create synergy in the Spanish speaking countries to accelerate brand awareness and adoption of Decred. We got together with Pablo and Nacho and talked about their work with DCRComic, their plans in the near future and how we must go were our users are instead of expecting the other way around. On this regard we talk about the efforts of the Brazilian community, how youtube and instagram are key platforms in Latin America, the new generation of users that is coming to crypto and how to use multimedia content to grab their attention into the decentralised infrastructure that Decred is building and why is important. We also organised a meeting with Crypto Rocket Group and talked about our plans for Latin America, the particularities of the ecosystem in Mexico and Argentina, Colombia and Chile as next priorities, a case for DCRTime as a product for government and universities, plans for next meet-ups and community organising in the country. We agree that there are three core focus to targeting Argentina, general public that is outside of crypto, the crypto community and developers.

Finally we assisted a Bitcoin introduction talk at Espacio Bitcoin, a co-working space dedicated to the crypto and blockchain ecosystem in Argentina and founded by Argentinian OGs from ONG Bitcoin Argentina, the first organisation in the country formally working with Bitcoin founded in 2013, the space is absolutely amazing. We were very happy to see in one of the screens of Espacio Bitcoin the logo of Decred as on August 16th the project was presented by Camilolwi from Crypto Rocket Group at Crypto Mondays gathering. It is fascinating to see how far the community has gone in Argentina, they are eager for alternatives and they have the resources and human power necessary to do it. The space feels more like a coinogstic space than a maximalist temple, and this sets the ground for innovation, community building and entrepreneurial efforts. Argentina’s community is tremendously advanced in the crypto industries, I see them as engines of adoption of permission less, censorship resistant and open source digital currencies. This is why Argentina has been for me a priority on the expansion plans of Decred en Español in Latin America.
