## Overview

Talent Land is the biggest technology event for students in Mexico and Decred has been a sponsor of the event for the second year. Due to COVID-19 this Talent Land postponed the IRL event and organised a virtual event during the week that was originally scheduled. The entire event was held on April 13-17, received more than 170,000 virtual attendees in over 50 presentations about blockchain, entrepreneurship, gaming, business, women and software development.

Decred team presented a panel titled "The future of money and remote work". The objective of the panel was to explore the intersection of money, technology and remote working through the lens and experience of 4 contractors of the project in LATAM. They shared their experience working remotely from Argentina, Colombia and Mexico, the challenges of it, and the opportunities that also arise from this work dynamic.

The team shared their experience using DCR as a global currency, the role of the contractor model to allow anyone to contribute, how the project is completely autonomous and designed to continuously grow even in the most harsh conditons. It was good opportunity to showcase what makes Decred unique and how the proyect is building some of the most innovative software in the cryptocurrency industry.

## Goals

The first goal of the panel was to explore how Decred is innovating in several areas from digital money to remote working. We wanted to create a conversation that would grow the imagination of our audience by putting Decred at the center of innovative ideas for the XXI century like cryptocurrency, blockchain, digital money, decentralisation, remote working and the potential to live and work in the Internet.

We recognise that the audience of Talent Land is not going to become stakeholders in the short term. But rather we see that this young segment of university students, mainly engineer and software students, will be keen to subjects in which Decred is tremendously powerful. Moreover, we are keen to continue exploring conversations that will inspire youngsters to be the best they can be in education and technology. We are certain that education is key for cryptocurrency adoption and putting our expertise at the center of these conversations is paramount to build awareness around the Decred Project.

## Learnings and Outcomes

The team received good comments on the panel due to its relevance in the times of COVID-19. And this is something that we wanted, to put the proyect at the center of a global discussion and how its innovative approach is setting good practices for other organisations to replicate. The panel was a good opportunity to set Decred in a bigger conversation. There was also good feedback in relation to the moderation of the panel, the responses and the fact that the team was representative of Mexico and Argentina.
