## Overall experience

The Open Banking, Fintech and Blockchain Summit was held in the St. Regis Hotel in Mexico City and was dedicated to bring together government regulators, banking executives and tech entrepreneurs to network and learn more about the future of open banking, fintech and the impact of blockchain technology in the financial sector. The event was mainly dedicated to the traditional banking industry and was a good opportunity to rise questions about the future of digital currencies in Mexico and Latam, digital identities in the context of sovereign identities and the implications of blockchain technology for business.

I was invited by the organisers of the Open Banking, Fintech and Blockchain Summit to talk about the future of digital identity and the role of blockchain technology to offer alternatives to sovereign identities. The panel was moderated by Nayam Hanashiro, Partner Management at R3, Adrian Cuadros, Executive Director of Government at Alestra, Jos√© Rodriguez, Director of Blockchain Land at Talent Land, Alejandro Lopez, Founder of Sistemas Akubica and, myself, Elian Huesca representing Decred Project.

It was interesting to notice that the panel had two very different points of view towards digital identity, the risks, challenges and potential use cases for digital identities. During the panel I gave a brief introduction to Decred, the importance of privacy and security of personal data from the perspective of a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation. Furthermore, I explained the differences between centralised, federated and sovereign identity, their main characteristics and examples of how these identities work. I received several complements from the audience due to the strong arguments to reflection on identity, user data protection and our self responsibility to take care of such information.

One of my core arguments for reflection on digital identities was the power that centralised corporations have to collect and mine personal data. I argued that sovereign identities are key for empowering those who want to take control over their data. Nonetheless, with great power comes great responsibility, being in control of our data requires a serious degree of technological involvement. One of the question that I put on the table was if we were ready to have such control or do we prefer to have a "forgot your password?" button. One of the key facts that resonated among the audience was the fact that 12 million people around the world do not have an identity, limiting everything they can do or access.
